# So You Want to Work at Claris?


First, thank you for taking the time to spending some time with us and we hope you enjoy this process as much as we do. 

Second, I want to reiterate that this isn't a take home test and there is no expectaion for you to do any coding for you before the actual interview. All we ask is that clone the repo and have the app running locally before the interview. 


Third, I can't give you the prompts or questions now...don't want to ruin all the fun....but you should expect to build a new componenet or two, interact and generate some services, and work with observables and some RxJS operators.
